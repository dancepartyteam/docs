## Update your game

Make sure your game is updated to the latest version; otherwise, the patching process will not work.  
To update, simply launch the game once and select `Yes` when prompted to install the update.

## Patching the Game

### 1. Obtain `EBOOT.BIN`

:::danger[Disclaimer: For CFW users]
Skip to step 3 if you're using CFW.
:::

1. On your PS3, navigate to **Settings → System Settings → System Information**.
2. Write down your IP Address; we'll need it in the next steps.
3. Navigate back to **Games** and turn on HEN.
4. On your PC, open FileZilla. Make sure your PC and PS3 are on the same network.
5. In FileZilla, enter your PS3's IP Address into the `Host` bar.
6. Connect to your PS3 by clicking **Quickconnect**. Accept the insecure FTP connection warning.
7. Navigate to `/dev_hdd0/game/`.
8. Find your game's folder by its Game ID. You can check the Game ID on the left side of the game’s box or look it up online. European copies start with `BLES`, while American ones start with `BLUS`.
9. Inside the game folder, open the `USRDIR` folder.
10. You’ll find your `EBOOT.BIN` file there. Copy it to your PC, but **do not close FileZilla**, as we'll still need it.

### 2. Patch the `EBOOT.BIN`

- Run the DanceParty patcher and provide the `EBOOT.BIN` file you just copied from your PS3:  
1. Drag and drop the file onto `patcher.exe`  
2. Or use the CLI:  
  ```bash
  patcher.exe path/to/EBOOT.bin
````

* The patcher will generate a patched `EBOOT.BIN` ready for your PS3.

### 3. Replace the Original EBOOT

1. Copy the patched `EBOOT.BIN` from your PC back to `/dev_hdd0/game/your_game_folder/USRDIR/`, replacing `your_game_folder` with your game's ID.
2. If prompted to overwrite, do so.
3. Once the copy finishes, close FileZilla and launch the game using your preferred game manager (we recommend webMAN MOD).

* Your game is now patched and ready to connect to the servers.

## Notes & Troubleshooting

* Ensure your PS3 is connected to the internet.
* Make sure the game is **fully updated** before patching.
* If your game doesn't connect to the servers:

  * Check your PS3 network settings.
  * Make sure the patched `EBOOT.BIN` is in the correct folder.
  * Make sure you're connected to PSN.
